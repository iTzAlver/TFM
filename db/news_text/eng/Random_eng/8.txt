$ WE ADVANCED AWAY AWAY
Virtually all matches at Pacto of Toledo have recommended linking pensions to IPC
It is a recommendation and is not binding
Let's see how pensions are currently revalued
Since 2013, pensions are increased by 0.25% annually
It is the so-called IRP, the revaluation index of Pensiones
That is, in a pension of 800 euros per month, there was an increase of about 2 euros
This had generated protests from many pensioners because they consider it insufficient
We have seen it in the streets in recent months
What will happen, if today's recommendation becomes reality? Algo Like this
The pensions would be revalued each year according to IPC
