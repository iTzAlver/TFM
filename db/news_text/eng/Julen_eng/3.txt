$ Good evening since the Parliament of Andalucía
This old church is the current Plenary Hall, and here Juan Manuel Moreno, Partido Popular, has become today in the new president of Junta of Andalucía
$ This was the moment of investiture, after the vote
59 votes in favor and 50 against
For the first time in four decades the PSOE will not be in the Andalusian government
PP and Ciudadanos will form the executive, thanks to the votes of Vox today in Parliament
$ This other image reflects the great media expectation before a historical change in the Autonomous Community
It is the time when Juan Manuel Moreno attended the press as soon as you leave the Lounge of Plenos
$ Immediately after attended Televisión Española
In a few minutes we offer those statements, in which Moreno has spoken of priorities and the stability of a government that will depend on 3 games
$ I trust that it has common sense, that there is a fundamental scam on politics
That the neighbors Andalucía are above the partisan or partisan interest
Another outstanding image of the day, just after the investiture
The embrace between Juan Manuel Moreno, The new president, and Susana Díaz, the president of the Junta to this day
Díaz will now lead the opposition from the Partido Socialista
$ The intervention of Susana Díaz, today in Parliament, and the confrontation of it with Moreno was one of the most expected moments
$ Has been the most intense
$ Susana Díaz APHA goes to Juan Moreno to reach the presidency with the support of VOX that if she is going to suppose the reduction of rights to the Andalusians
$ He is going to talk with all groups
That sees it destructed
$ Buried the Franco regime
$ You go with the heirs of that Franco regime
$ Has come to the disoriented Parliament
With inertia of the past that have done so much damage Andalucía
All groups have intervened today
Go ahead Andalucía says that the new government will work for the rich
From Ciudadanos they are counted to their agreements with the PP to govern and uncheck the covenant between VOX and the popular
Vox has supported the investiture and from the tribune they maintain that they will not renounce their program
$ Vox, Lord Candidate, will not renounce any of its approaches including the repeal of the laws of gender ideological perspective
$ In a few minutes we give them all the details
The rest of the present, from Torrespaña with Ana Roldán

I tell you what I have told you from the first moment, we are dead, but with the hope that we have an angel that is going to help

With a march they have approached the place where they are looking for the child, with messages of support and hope
