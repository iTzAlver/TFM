$ Good evening since the Parliament of Andalusia
This old church is the current Lounge of Plenos, and here Juan Manuel Moreno, the Popular Party, has become the new president of the Junta de Andalucía
$ This was the moment of investiture, after the vote
59 votes in favor and 50 against
For the first time in four decades, the PSOE will not be in the Andalusian government
PP and citizens will form the executive, thanks to the votes of Vox today in Parliament
$ This other image reflects the great media expectation before a historical change in the Autonomous Community
It is the time when Juan Manuel Moreno attended the press as soon as he left the Plenary Hall
$ Immediately after he attended Spanish Television
In a few minutes we offer these statements, in which Moreno has spoken of priorities and the stability of a government that will depend on 3 games
$ I trust that it has been common, that there is a fundamental scam on politics
That the Andalusian neighbors are above the partisan or partisan interest
Another outstanding image of the day, right after the investiture
The embrace between Juan Manuel Moreno, the new president, and Susana Díaz, the president of the Board to this day
Díaz will now lead the opposition from the banking of the Socialist Party
$ The intervention of Susana Díaz, today in Parliament, and the confrontation of it with Moreno was one of her most anticipated moments
$ Has been the most intense
$ Susana Díaz Alasa goes to Juan Moreno to reach the presidency with Vox's support that if he is going to suppose the reduction of rights to Andalusians
$ He is going to talk to all groups
That he sees it misconception
$ Buried the Franco regime
$ You go with the heirs of that Franco regime
$ Has come to the disoriented parliament
With inertia of the past that have done so much Andalusia damage
All groups have intervened today
Forward Andalusia says that the new government will work for the rich
Since citizens are cigarent to their agreements with the PP to govern and become unmarked from the covenant between Vox and the Popular
VOX has supported the investiture and from the tribune they maintain that they will not renounce their program
$ Vox, Lord Candidate, will not give up any of its approaches including the repeal of the laws of gender ideological perspective
$ In a few minutes we give them all the details
